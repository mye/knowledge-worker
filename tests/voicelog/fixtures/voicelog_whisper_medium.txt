[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   Okay, so if this just works and depends on the text file, that would be great.
[00:01:43.398 --> 00:01:50.278]   So basically when I restart it, I want to be up to date.
[00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.028]   Okay.
[00:01:58.028 --> 00:01:58.908]   Okay.
[00:05:57.068 --> 00:06:25.948]   But do we want this to be Python programs?
[00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:13.308]   I would much rather have it be a more abstract language.
[00:14:56.988 --> 00:15:24.988]   Okay.
[00:15:18.588 --> 00:15:20.588]   So I think I'll just try to...
[00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.588]   So I think I'll just try to...
[00:15:28.398 --> 00:15:30.398]   To...
[00:15:30.398 --> 00:15:32.398]   To...
[00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:35.708]   To...
[00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:37.708]   To...
[00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:39.708]   To...
[00:16:02.548 --> 00:16:04.548]   Users, stream, documents...
[00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:06.548]   Users, stream, documents...
[00:17:17.878 --> 00:17:19.878]   Now I can see the results.
[00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:21.878]   Now I can see the results.
[00:17:21.878 --> 00:17:23.878]   Now I can see the results.
[00:17:22.888 --> 00:17:24.888]   Okay, as you can see, it doesn't work.
[00:17:24.888 --> 00:17:26.888]   Okay, as you can see, it doesn't work.
[00:17:28.888 --> 00:17:30.888]   Okay, as you can see, it doesn't work.
[00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:40.148]   I only said this once.
[00:18:44.078 --> 00:18:46.078]   I only said this once.
[00:18:46.078 --> 00:18:48.078]   I only said this once.
[00:18:53.398 --> 00:19:21.398]   I only said this once.
[00:19:06.788 --> 00:19:08.788]   I only said this once.
[00:19:08.788 --> 00:19:10.788]   I only said this once.
[00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:12.788]   I only said this once.
[00:19:12.788 --> 00:19:14.788]   I only said this once.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   So maybe this just completely overwrote the file.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   That's possible.
[00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:19.698]   Okay, but it did add a new captured file.
[00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:48.848]   That is a really weird bug.
[00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:53.848]   That is a really weird bug.
[00:00:53.028 --> 00:00:58.028]   So I think what it's doing is
[00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:01.028]   So I think what it's doing is
[00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:07.128]   It's a bug in the transcription code where it waits for new
[00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:10.128]   It's a bug in the transcription code where it waits for new
[00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:18.138]   input while it's trying to decide whether it has to start transcribing
[00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:19.138]   while it's trying to decide whether it has to start transcribing
[00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:22.138]   and then it somehow transcribes the
[00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:26.598]   buffer content that is already in there and then it's just repeating the same thing.
[00:02:10.948 --> 00:02:10.948]   Thank you.
[00:02:10.948 --> 00:02:11.948]   Thank you.
[00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:12.948]   Thank you.

[00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:13.948]   Thank you.
[00:02:33.108 --> 00:03:01.108]   Is transcribing a bunch of nonsense?
[00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:44.398]   [cough]
[00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:45.398]   [cough]
